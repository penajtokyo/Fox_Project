        <p>Foxes are small-to-medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. 
            Foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush).

        <br>
        <p>Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. 
            Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group,
             which consists of bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.
